# Contributing

Please follow these guidelines when contributing:

- Use Conventional Commits for commit messages (e.g. feat: add button)
- Run `npm run format` to format code
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run lint:fix` to fix lint issues
- Ensure tests (if any) pass before pushing

Enterprise note: pushes to protected branches require passing CI, commitlint and pre-push checks.
